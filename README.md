# my-first-website
This is, how the title suggests, my first webpage. I didn't want to spend too much time on the actual content on the page, I mainly just wanted to fulfill the minimum requirements so that I could move on in the curriculum, since I obviously plan to build more and better websites, and the content could have me come back to this later.
